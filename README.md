# Portfolio 2021

* At least once each two years I change my portfolio to practice my habilities and test my design and perfomance web skills. I invite you to see this code at GitHub, I challenged myself to make this SPA from zero and I've tried to do this based on Angular behaviors, with Routes, a NgOnInit equivalent for each page and a script that is load for each page based on the browser route. All this website including the design was made by me 

* Technologies: HTML, SCSS, a lot of JS and Gulp for Production ) _
